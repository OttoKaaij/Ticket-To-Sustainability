## Rules 

## The objective. 

Have the most points at the end of the game to win. Points are earned in three ways: 

1. claiming Routes, 
2. collecting Sustainability Tokens, 
3. collecting unique Green Foundation Tokens, and 
4. completing Destination Tickets.

Points are deducted for failed Destination Tickets.  

## The setup. Before the first round is played, each player receives: 

1) 20 Cable Cars in a color of their choosing, 
2) two randomly drawn Sustainability Cards, 
3) two randomly drawn Destination Tickets, of which one may be discarded.

The board is then setup by placing five randomly drawn Sustainability Cards face-up, and by stacking Green Foun- dation Tokens of the same symbol on the Green Foundation Locations marked red on the board.  Taking turns. On a player’s turn, they may do only one of the following actions:

- **Draw Sustainability Cards**. The player may draw two cards randomly from the deck or from the face-up cards. Cards taken from the face-ups, must be imme- diately replaced from the deck. If the player picks a wildcard from the face-ups, they may only draw once.

- **Draw two Destination Tickets**. They may discard one.
- **Claim a Route** and initiate a Discussion. Each route consists of a number of colored blocks. The player must play the same amount of Sustainability Cards in the same color as the colored blocks. To mark the Route as claimed, the player places its Cable Cars on the blocks.
    - Claiming a Clean Route initiates a Discussion. The player may choose one of the Discussion Prompts from one of their played Clean Cards. The initiating player may contribute to the Discussion first. Other players are then welcomed to contribute. The major- ity of the group then decides whether a contribution was positive, i.e. it provided a valid or interesting point. Each positive contributor receives one Sustainability Token.
    - If the Route connects with a Green Foundation Location, the player is rewarded one Green Foundation Token if they have claimed more Clean Routes than Dirty Routes.
    - Dirty Cards do not have Discussion Prompts, so no Discussion can be initiated when claiming Dirty Roads.
    - Claiming a Route with Dirty Cards costs one Sustain- ability Token, whereas using Clean Cards rewards one Sustainability Token.
    – Grey Routes can be claimed by a set of same-colored Sustainability Cards in the color of the player’s choosing.
    – Wildcards can take any color.

### Ending the game. 

When a player has less than three Cable Cars remaining, everyone gets one final turn. Points are scored for:
- each claimed Route. Longer routes give more points, as stated on the board.
- each completed Destination Ticket, as stated on the Destination Ticket. Deduct the stated points for each failed Destination Ticket.
- each unique Green Foundation Token collected. The more unique tokens you have the more points you get, as stated on the board.
- each Sustainability Token, which gives one point each.
